# 💼 Prodigy FS 02 – Interactive UI Web Page with CRUD-like Operations

A simple yet modern front-end web application designed as part of the **Prodigy Internship Program – Task 2**. The project demonstrates essential UI concepts along with CRUD-like behavior using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## ✨ Features

- ✅ **Create (C):** Add new UI components dynamically (like mode toggling or user interactions)

- 📝 **Update (U):** Change the state of the page using the dark/light mode toggle
- ❌ **Delete (D):** Remove applied themes or reset UI changes (via toggle or script logic)

> ⚙️ While this project does not use a database, it simulates CRUD behavior through **JavaScript-controlled DOM manipulation**.
